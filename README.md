# Patent Manager

## Description

A simple web application to manage patents.

## Installation

I am very unaware as to how to make these installation instructions viable on more secure machines, however, I am using
* PHP locally
* NPM locally
* Composer/Artisan locally

to install the depencies, run ```npm install``` after cloning the repository.

## Running the servers
Run ```npm serve``` to start the Laravel server.
Run ```npm watch``` to start the React Client.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the client.
default user is 'admin'
default password is 'password'.

### Note
Email functionalities will not work unless the .env is properly configured with a compatible email.
refer to .env.example and save it as .env when configured
